The Marvellous
Monsieur Sardou

VICTORIA DAILEY

Anything coming from Sardou notably interests the world,
but it particularly intoxicates Parisians.’

Now largely forgotten, Victorien Sardou (1831-1908) was one of
the most popular and prolific of r9th-century French playwrights,
known far and wide for his seventy plays, most of which were in-
credibly successful and starred the leading performers of the time,
including Sarah Bernhardt, Gabrielle Réjane, Frédérick Lemaitre
and Benoit-Constant Coquelin. Generally, the critics heaped praise
on Sardou: He was called ‘the dean of French dramatists’ and ‘the
master of the well-made play’. Among his playwriting peers were
Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas (fils) and Eugéne Scribe. Yet to-
day, his name has lost its former lustre, and if remembered at all,
itis for just three of his plays: La Tosca (1887), which starred Sarah
Bernhardt and which became the basis for Puccini’s illustrious opera
of 1900; Fédora (1882), which supplied the word for the ever-fash-
ionable hat, featured Bernhardt in the title role, was turned into
an opera in 1898, a novel in 1894 and nine films produced between
i915 and 1947; and Madame Sans-Géne (1893), written for Réjane,
Bernhardt’s great friend and rival, and which became an opera in
1915 as well as six films made between 1900 and 2002.”

While these are some impressive credits, I have discovered that
Sardou was much more than just a successful playwright. What is
